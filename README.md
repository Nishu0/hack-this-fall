## About Project

"KnowledgeKnights" is a cutting-edge education and gaming platform that offers young people a fun and engaging way to learn. Our platform features a wide variety of educational games that cover a range of subjects, including math, science, history, and more. Each game is designed to be both entertaining and educational, helping children build important skills and knowledge in a way that is both enjoyable and memorable.

In addition to our games, "KnowledgeKnights" also features a unique quiz platform that allows children to test their knowledge and build their confidence. Our quizzes are designed to be fun and engaging, and they cover a wide range of subjects and topics, ensuring that there is something for everyone.

We understand the importance of competition and recognition in a child's learning journey, that's why we've included a leader-board for each game. Children can see how they rank against their peers and work to improve their scores. Additionally, we keep track of each student's progress, allowing parents and teachers to see their scores and monitor their progress.

## How we built it

The development process of KnowledgeKnights began with the creation of a prototype using Figma. This was done to have a visual representation of the project and to validate the design before proceeding to the implementation stage.

After the prototype was created, the team moved to the Frontend and Backend development. For the Frontend, they used a combination of technologies including ejs (Embedded JavaScript), scss (Sassy CSS), css (Cascading Style Sheets), and tailwind (a utility-first CSS framework). This combination of technologies allowed the team to create a visually appealing and interactive user interface.

The Backend of KnowledgeKnights was built using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment, and Express.js, a popular web framework for Node.js. The team also used Twilio-OTP Service to handle one-time password (OTP) verification for security purposes. The data for the application was stored in a MongoDB database, which is a NoSQL database management system.

In conclusion, the development of KnowledgeKnights was done using a combination of Frontend and Backend technologies, which allowed the team to create a functional and visually appealing application.


## Troubleshooting/Challenges

The development of KnowledgeKnights was not without challenges, and two of the most significant challenges that the team encountered were the integration of the Static Frontend Game UI and the speech to text translation and synchronization with the game.

The integration of the Static Frontend Game UI was challenging because it required converting a static user interface into a dynamic system where the teacher could add questions according to their preference. This involved complex coding and debugging to ensure that the dynamic functionality worked seamlessly with the game.

The speech to text translation and synchronization with the game was another time-consuming challenge. This feature required accurate speech recognition and translation into text, as well as ensuring that the translation was in sync with the game. This required significant testing and tweaking to get the feature to work seamlessly and accurately.

In conclusion, the development of KnowledgeKnights was not without challenges, and as a team we had to overcome significant obstacles in the integration of the Static Frontend Game UI and the speech to text translation and synchronization with the game. However, through our perseverance and hard work, we were able to successfully develop a functional and user-friendly application.
